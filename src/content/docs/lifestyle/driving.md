## Safety Equipment

Your car should have the following safety equipment to ensure safety in an emergency!

-   Window breaker
-   Seatbelt cutter
-   Safety cones/pylons
-   Instant tire repair kit (air canister with sealant, or self-repair kit)

## Rules to Live By

When driving long distances, it is always good to fill up on gas completely. Moreover, if
you live in a place where inclement weather or catastrophe is common -- such as fires in
the Okanagan -- you should try to ensure that you always have a half-tank of gas remaining
in your garage. This is just in case you need to escape in a hurry! Gas stations tend to
fill up really fast in an emergency.
