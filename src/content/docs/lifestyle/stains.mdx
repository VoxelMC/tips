## Sweat Stains

If you have a shirt with yellow-ish stains from sweat, you can use a sodium bicarbonate
paste (mostly powder, just watery enough to look like toothpaste) and a toothbrush.

<Steps>

1. Using a toothbrush, scoop up some paste and work it into the affected region, moving in
   circles. Be careful not to disturb the weave of the fabric!

2. Leave the paste on the shirt (or garment, otherwise) for around twenty minutes to a
   half-hour, then wash it out with water.

3. If able, throw it in in the wash, but if the garment is not machine washable, just make
   sure to get all of the bicarbonate out in the sink. Once the slippery feeling goes
   away, you are done rinsing!

</Steps>
