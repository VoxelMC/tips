## Types of Wine

The type of wine is determined by the winemaker, grapes, and sometimes method of
preparation. Different wines usually have different tastes, pair with different meals, and
have different alcohol content or properties.

### White Wine

White wine is made from a variety of grapes with "white" skins. The lack of colour comes
from the wine not being made with the skin, and instead only with the **pulp** of the
grapes. Typical varieties of white wine grapes are **Chardonnay**, **Sauvignon Blanc**,
**Riesling**, **Müller-Thurgau**, **Muscat**, **Gevürztraminer**, and **Petite Arvine**.
There are other varieties, as well -- my favourite grape not listed here is **Sémillon**.

#### Flavour and Pairings

At a glance, white wines are usually well paired with white fish, and chicken. With this
in mind, each wine has a few meals that just go perfectly in marriage with one another.

#### Storage

White wine can be stored in a **fridge**, **wine cellar**, or at **room temperature**. It
is really a matter of preference, as well as the intended use of the wine. For example,
there is no need to refrigerate cooking wine.

### Red Wine

The red colour of red wine comes from the **anthocyanins** present in the skin of dark
grapes. Anthocyanins are a class of organic molecules which are responsible for a lot of
the colours found in plants (though not all). They are usually pH sensitive, as is with
flowers such as hydrangeas.
