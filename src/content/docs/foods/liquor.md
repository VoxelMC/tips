## Different Types of Alcoholic Drinks

In the world of liquor, there are a tonne of different types of drinks that are used for a
wide variety of purposes. For example, liqueurs are usually for mixing cocktails, and
spirits can be used for cocktails, drinking straight up, or even cooking.

### Liqueurs

There are many different types and
[brands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_liqueur_brands) of liqueurs. However, they
share in common a high sugar content, lots of flavour usually from fruits, herbs, or nuts,
and range between 15% and 55% alcohol content.

Some of my favourites include:

-   **Haskap liqueur**; from the haskap berry
    ([link](https://okanaganspirits.com/products/liqueur/haskap/))
-   **Creme de cassis**; from blackcurrant, good in the Kir Royale cocktail
-   **Malibu**; coconut rum, great with fruit juices or on its own
    ([link](https://www.malibudrinks.com/en-ca/products/malibu-original/))
-   **Amaretto/Disaronno**; from almonds, quite sweet with a nice aroma

> flavoured liqueurs that bring life to any party, in my opinion._
